Affiliate Marketing is when a business sales or customer acquisition to another business in return for a commission.
This is generally done through affiliate networks which provide a marketplace for merchants (those outsourcing) and publishers to enter into deals.
AffClicks solves the problem of affiliates data being disjointed, locked up both of affiliate and PPC networks. Given better presentation of actionable data and recommendations affiliates can improve their profitability.
