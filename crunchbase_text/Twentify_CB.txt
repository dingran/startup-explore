Twentify is a mobile insights platform that allows companies to conduct market research. Companies either mobilize a vast consumer base to capture quick data about their stores or ask questions directly to real consumers to learn their behavior and attitude towards products and ideas.
Unlike traditional market research companies, Twentify leverages smartphone technology and their app Bounty has 300.000+ real consumers from all over the world. So Twentify is a faster, more affordable and richer alternative to traditional market research solutions. Twentify is working with global CPGs, Retailers, Internet Companies and Banks such as Unilever, P&G, Google, Puma, Samsung, Danone, Carrefour and Garanti BankasÄ±.
