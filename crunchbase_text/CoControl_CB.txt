CoControl is a heating control and budget management system, which has been co-designed specifically with landlords such as yours. Their goal is to provide you with the comfiest home whilst balancing your finances. Unlike existing smart thermostats, CoControl’s ‘fit and forget’ solution comes with a simple two-button remote or ‘comfort switch’ combining your responses with your needs.
