Radius tethers digital content to physical locations by allowing users to create virtual beacons that can transmit whatever content they want to users near them.  These beacons can be followed so users know the latest about the places they love.  Anywhere a Radius user goes, they can pull out their phone and see the content most relevant to them based on their location, social network, interests, and the beacons they have previously found relevant.
