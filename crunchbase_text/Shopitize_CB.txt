Shopitize is a mobile marketing platform that drives shoppers to store to purchase, validates the purchase via a photo of a receipt and delivers a range of rewards, all without a Point-of Sale integration. 
Shopitize activates offers directly on shoppers’ smartphones across Shopitize powered apps and mobile websites, including a unique network of channel and media partners, bringing large-scale reach and network effects to both brands and retailers.
It validates the purchase in real time based on a photo of the receipt submitted by shoppers. Shopitize directly rewards the shopper with either cash transmitted to bank account or via PayPal, or through cost effective non-monetary rewards such as vouchers, points or other reward types via reward partners.
Shopitize automatically collects and analyses all data on receipts across multiple retailers and dynamically segments and targets shoppers by their behavioural profiles so that it may structure personally relevant deals to them.
Shopitize provides brands and retailers a smarter and a more cost-efficient way of delivering traditional and proven marketing tactics and mechanics such as supporting product launches, product promotions, sampling campaigns, sweepstakes, ‘Buy 1, Get 1 For Free’, competitions, customer surveys and loyalty programmes.
The products and solutions are either supporting short-term one-off campaigns, or are based on a long-term integrated partnership with the customer.
