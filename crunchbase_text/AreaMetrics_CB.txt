Your mobile device understands you. From cuisine and travel destinations to music and outdoor activities, your device has been curated to your likes and preferences by the person who knows you best... You.
As our world becomes more connected through IoT technologies such as digital displays, connected cars, and wearables, the real-world environment is becoming increasingly customizable to your specific interests and preferences.
Our mission is to personalize the world around you by bringing these interests and preferences off of the screen and into your real-world environment.
