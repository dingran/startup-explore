Pop Feedback is a web application that allows companies to learn about their customers quickly and easily by giving them the tools to place quick one question surveys on any page of their website.
Pop Feedback was created by two entrepreneurs, who wanted to get quick feedback on their web application, but didn't want to pay a premium for such a simple tool that would allow them to do so. Instead of paying a premium, they decided to create their own tool and offer it to other entrepreneurs who also don't want to pay a premium for this type of tool.
Their philosophy is that simple tools should have a simple price.
