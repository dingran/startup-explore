PaperShare is the Content Marketing Cloud with real-time distribution that delivers leads from your content.
PaperShare transforms the content marketing process by putting content at the center of companies' customer acquisition process. With one click, they can publish their content across all possible marketing channels, including blogs & websites, search engines, social networks, sales and marketing teams, and even ads. 
Then they can engage directly with viewers via PaperShare's social login per piece of content, which provides authenticated social data that has much greater context about the viewer. With PaperShare, marketers can go from publishing, to seeing how their content performed across earned, owned and paid channels, to engaging with viewers within minutes.
Used by companies including Intel, Cisco, Hortonworks and Dale Carnegie Training, PaperShare closed on a seed round in July 2012 with investors that included Rembrandt Venture Partners and Michael Baum (founder of Splunk).
