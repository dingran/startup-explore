AmigoCloud has gone from humble, coffee shop, beginnings to recruiting standout engineering talent and moving into a prestigious co-working space.  Both co-founders share a love for mobile devices and GIS. Ragi Burhum (also the Bay Areaâ€™s GeoMeetup chair) worked on core Geo technologies at ESRI and Microsoft, while Victor Chernetsky focussed on OpenGL graphics and mobile/embedded device programming at Delphi and Pioneer.
