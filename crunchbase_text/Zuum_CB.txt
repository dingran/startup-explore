Zuum is a social media content strategy tool. It shows marketers what type of content will maximize impact with their social media fans and followers, generating a higher return on their social media properties.
Zuum accomplishes that by focusing on three major data types. Benchmarking, Content publishing, and Community.

Benchmarking: 
Helps marketers get a quick understanding of how their social media presence ranks among all the competitors in an industry, as well as quickly assembling periodic status reports.
Content Performance: 
Shows marketers what types of social media content is most resonating in a given industry, and identify key content trends long before other marketers will be aware of them.
Community Activity: 
Highlights key community trends, who the top influencers are, and what theyâ€™re doing to attain that influence.
