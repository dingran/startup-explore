Typeform is a cloud based application that is reinventing the way users create and respond to surveys and other types of forms, by making the process more user-friendly and engaging for both creators and end users.
Being the first device-agnostic form solution, Typeform provides creators with peace of mind that their forms will have the same great look and feel on any smartphone, tablet or web browser.
The company was founded in early 2012 by Robert Mu√±oz & David Okuniev who both previously ran digital agencies specializing in UI/UX and web development.
