SEA-TACT brings a new fascinating experience to the world of yacht sailing. With SEA-TACT you can play, race and enjoy a tactical sailing adventure without any logistic preparations or complex coordination.
All you need is your smartphone or tablet, and you are set to go sailing. You can go by yourself or several boats together. Your mobile devices serve as your consoles, but it’s your boats that you actually play with! No preparations are required – no buoys, no referees, no sirens. Everything you need is already there, day and night!
The races/games are monitored and controlled by the SEA-TACT servers.  They use your GPS devices to track all the participants and display  a map of the match on your screens. They also monitor the compliance with the game rules and  declare penalties, and they determine the winners!
