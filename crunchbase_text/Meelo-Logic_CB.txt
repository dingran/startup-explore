Meelo is a causal reasoning enterprise AI that transforms underutilized data into intelligence for optimization, automation, compliance, and growth. Our patent pending Context in Time AI (CIT) goes beyond clustering by delivering new levels of clarity revealing causation, central topics, key events, and influential individuals – especially when there’s a high degree of data heterogeneity and complexity. By providing AI as a Service, Meelo is able to connect enterprise and web data to provide intelligence on who, what, where, when, how and the elusive WHY.
