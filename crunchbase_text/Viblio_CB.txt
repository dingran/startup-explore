We apply video recognition technology to automatically filter and organize videos as they get automatically uploaded to your private online library.
With VIBLIO Magic Tagging™, videos are automatically organized into interesting collections or video albums - by place, person, or activity. You can create your own private communities that share videos they have taken around an event, whether it’s a casual social event like a ski trip or a life transition like a wedding. With VIBLIO, everyone in a community can have their own private video library, and at the same time can grant controlled access of their specific videos of an event to the community’s video album
