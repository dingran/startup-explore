StorNetworks has built the 'LykeBox' Social Loyalty Platform that rewards people for interacting with brands they like.
Our vision:
LinkedIn is for professional relationships.
Facebook is for social relationships.
Lykebox is for brand relationships.
For users, It's one app to follow and communicate with the companies where you spend  money.  It aggregates email, FB, Google+1,and Twitter communication from these companies into one place.  You earn points for doing what you already do: reading or sharing a message or post, making a purchase, or answering questions & polls. LykePoints can be redeemed in  various ways for products, services, or donations.
Companies create their LykeBox profile for free.
They then use 'LykeManager' to:
-setup their points & rewards
-promote their LykeBox presence via the LykeWidget or Lyke Display ads
-get analytics on which social messages and channels are most effective
-create deals, alerts, games, &  polls to further engage their Lykers
Stor has 7 patents pending around their technology, & strong early traction  both with users and brands.  Every time a marketer builds a Lykebox profile and promotes it, Stor gets new users into the network.
