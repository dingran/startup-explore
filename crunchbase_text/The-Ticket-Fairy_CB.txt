The Ticket Fairy is a marketing and analytics solution that helps events to get more, relevant attendees and secure their ticket income in advance.
Running events is a huge risk. Costs can be massive (in the millions of dollars) and multiple factors affect attendance - even something as simple as rain can result in a 25% drop in on-the-door sales. 
They are used by large events to:
- Increase revenue (typically by 10-25%) 
- Lower marketing costs 
- Increase social reach, to the right people 
- Manage and optimise advertising campaigns across multiple channels, including automating audience targeting 
- Reduce ticket resale fraud/scalping 
- Automate day-to-day business admin 
- Gain insights into customer demographics & brand engagement via social profile analytics 
- Plan future events via data-driven decision making, increasing event relevancy
