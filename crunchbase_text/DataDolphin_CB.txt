datadolph.in is in public beta. It makes data discovery, data visualization and sharing stories as easy as 1-2-3. 
datadolph.in is organizing world's public data and offers a cloud-based service to discover data using Google like search.
Once datasets are discovered, datadolph.in makes visualization super simple by automatically building most appropriate chart right in datadolph.in's platform. 
The data visualization can then be turned into micro-stories (datagrams) and shared on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn.
