StreetPin is a global network of localised, community 'notice boards', creating open interaction around any neighbourhood, business, event or venue. 
We provide a new social media tool, ideal for communication, entertainment and advertising via mobile devices.
To use a current buzzword - StreetPin is a 'SoLoMo' (social, location, mobile) platform with a viral focus, user incentives & a distinct revenue model from the outset 
The current team is made up of web, mobile and travel professionals. Collectively, we have decades of experience in design, development and management across a myriad of softwares & platforms. Our strong technical team would benefit from added marketing expertise.
