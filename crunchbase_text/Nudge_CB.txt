Nudge used to be the top  London based social media agency creating engaging applications for brands on Facebook.
In 2010 it was acquired by Syncapse, a global social media technology provider headquartered in Canada. Together with Syncapse's existing team in London, we now build social campaigns, manage global fan pages and measure social data to achieve stellar value for our clients.
