We, at Intentex, have developed a unique text-analysis engine that can reveal the real intent of a text in just a few seconds. Our system will show you information about the preferred communication style of your respondent, and help you easily understand the intent, emotions and attitude hidden in the text you are reading or writing. It will even show if the text seems sincere or not.
We provide accurate, effective and highly innovative sentiment analysis features, which are unique on the market. Our lexicon-based sentiment engine can provide detailed analysis of texts, showing users what effects the words they use have on their readers in ways that by far surpass our competitors.
Intentex text-analysis technology, which works in a similar way to a spell checker, lets you uncover more information from texts than you ever thought is possible. It lets you understand others better and understand how they will feel when reading/hearing your text, allowing you to tailor your message to get the response you want. Current categories of results reveal hidden information about: emotions, communication style, sincerity, attitude, timeline, motivation type and perceptual positions, and they are constantly researching and adding more types of results.
