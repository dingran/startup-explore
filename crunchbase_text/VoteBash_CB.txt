VoteBash gives brands real-time feedback, the ability to create brand ambassadors and a new way to retarget for future advertising. The way it works is that brands ask questions and people are incentivized to vote, which creates viral sharing. It is always free for consumers to vote. You can ask timely questions, create incentives for people to vote, create brand ambassadors with a viral VoteBash pin-button, get real-time feedback and re-target your voters with a personalized message.
VoteBash was launched in 2014 by Martijn Atell. It is based in Raleigh, N.C. The application is available for Mac, PC, iOS, and Android.
