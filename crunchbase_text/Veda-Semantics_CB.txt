Veda Semantics provides semantic technology that can capture the meaning of information and domain specific relationships. It supports the integration of structured, semi-structured and unstructured information automatically, making enterprise business applications more effective.
Most business applications today rely largely on structured data inputs. However, electronic mails, data spread sheets, design documents, the web and several other electronic information repositories represent perhaps a significant and important source of business intelligence. Unfortunately, this data resides in semi structured and unstructured data repositories, and the lack of structure and distribution of data sources gives rise to the most demanding challenge - finding relevant information within a huge data set, which can serve timely customer support, increase employee productivity and enable competent management decision-making.
Veda Semantics believes that business intelligence inputs to an organisationâ€™s decision-making process would stand to benefit immensely if empowered to analyse all the available data through smart retrieval, analysis and presentation. Veda provides the 'cutting edge' to existing business applications, by enabling a fast, reliable and seamless flow of information between heterogeneous data sources.
