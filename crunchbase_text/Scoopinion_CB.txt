Scoopinion: Discover Stories Worth Reading
Scoopinion analyses users reading habits, finds readers with similar interests and quietly recommends stories they have read well.
Instead of focusing to clicks, shares or likes, Scoopinion sifts out the meaningful content by implicitly rating each article according to the way they are read within the community. The Browser add-on rates articles only from the 1000 whitelisted Newspapers and Blogs.
