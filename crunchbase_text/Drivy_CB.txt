Drivy is the leading car rental marketplace in Europe. The service allows its users to rent peopleâ€™s cars everywhere within walking distance of home whenever they need one: whether it is to go away for a weekend, attend a business meeting or organise a move. The service includes a comprehensive insurance coverage to ensure safe rentals. Drivy provides a full mobile experience, from booking a car to check-in and check-out, and has recently launched Drivy Open, a technology which enables people to open cars with their smartphones and carry out self-service rentals.
