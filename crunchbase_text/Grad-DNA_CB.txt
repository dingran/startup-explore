Grad DNA is the ingenious new way for students and employers to find each other. We offer employer-approved tests to identify any student’s strengths, then match them specifically to employers who want what they have.  
We’re a team of graduate recruitment specialists and occupational psychologists who were dissatisfied with the way things were. So we went ahead and changed the game. 
Alongside our expert testing partners, we’ve created a unique series of aptitude, personality and situational judgement tests, designed specifically for mobile. Students take these tests on our easy-to-use app. If they’re suited to an employer’s profile, they’re matched to that employer’s profile. With Grad DNA, everyone wins.
