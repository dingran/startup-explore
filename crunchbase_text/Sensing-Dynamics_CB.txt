Sensing Dynamics is a start-up from Montreal, Canada that is developing CloudSense, an electronic nose platform. CloudSense is a ubiquitous chemical sensing platform technology that can quantify and identify chemical footprints that are omnipresent in our environment. This ability to sense chemical fingerprints in a smart environment can provide context to the decision making process in smart devices.
