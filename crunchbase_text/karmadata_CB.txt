karmadata is healthcare (big) data, simplified.  The karmadata team is on a mission to change the way users obtain and interact with healthcare information.  Using big data and cloud technologies, we are able to standardize and link the world's healthcare data ranging from leading open data sources to private pharmacy and medical claims. Our users can then follow items of interest (such as diseases, drugs, physicians, or corporations) through a real time Feed, and create impactful visualizations through their Datacards.
karmadata currently processes high value, open and private data sources on a daily basis like PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System, the USPTO databases, among many others.  These sources are primarily semi-structured text or XML, that are not linked to each other, and provide no standards for querying, analyzing, or visualizing.  karmadata has processed over 100 million records to date, and identified over 6.1 million Entities that are healthcare providers, populated places, clinical investigators, diseases, organizations, drugs and more.
