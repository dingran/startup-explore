Wedding Spot is the first online marketplace that allows users to search, price, and book thousands of wedding venues. Working directly with venues, Wedding Spot gathers all the information required to allow newly engaged couples to easily search for venues based on budget, location, style, and guest count. Users can "build out" their ideal wedding day by selecting specific services and options to see a price estimate and then book a venue viewing appointment with one click of a button. Wedding Spotâ€™s proprietary technology enables wedding venues to manage their entire wedding booking process on its platform, including acquiring customers, organizing content, and marketing inventory. Launched in August 2013, Wedding Spot is based in San Francisco, CA and is backed by leading VC investors.
