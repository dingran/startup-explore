Chainlink Relationship Marketing specializes in the execution of database marketing initiatives and automation programs, powered by their proprietary SAAS platform.   
The Chainlink Marketing platform deploys targeted and responsive Email messages and serves up personalized landing pages and embed-able forms, all of which sits on top of a unique data warehouse that facilitates the recipient segmentation and intelligence programming necessary to deploy this type of 1:1 marketing.
The platform is delivered through managed implementations (marketers and agencies provide the creative content of the messaging sequences, while Chainlink specialists test, launch and maintain the campaigns) which allows clients to launch their marketing programs with limited ramp up and training time, but still have the access to reporting analytics and  sophisticated automation tools.  Chainlink’s platform is built with an open API framework that facilitates the integration of 3rd party analytics, CRM, ERP, and other accessible systems.  
Ultimately, Chainlink Relationship Marketing removes the need for IT and empowers creative teams to focus on creating premier content for personalized experiences, eliminating the marketers having to worry about the technical aspects of serving each of those individual messages up.
